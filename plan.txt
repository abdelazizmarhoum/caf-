## Phase 3: Customer Ordering Flow

- [ ] **Public Interface**:
    - [ ] Route `/table/:tableId` with validation (check if table exists).
    - [ ] "Confirm Table" screen.

    - [ ] Staff performance metrics (avg prep time).

## Phase 7: Polish & Deployment

- [ ] **Security Audit**: API rate limiting, Input validation.
- [ ] **Deployment**:
    - [ ] Backend (e.g., Render/Railway).
    - [ ] Frontend (e.g., Vercel/Netlify).
